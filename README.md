## Backend
- Node: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Express: A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js.
- Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies for both frontend and backend using `npm install`.
3. Start the frontend and backend development servers using `npm start`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application in action.

Feel free to customize and extend this template to fit your specific project requirements.
